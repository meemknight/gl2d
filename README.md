# gl2d
A simple 2D library made with OpenGL.

## Why gl2d?

Because you can just drop it into your already configured OpenGL project and you have a lightweight 2D library ready to go!
It all boils down to one render rectangle function so you can even easily integrate it into your framework if needed.

---

Setup: just copy the header and the cpp
Call gl2d::init();
Create a renderer class.
Update its window size if the window size changed
